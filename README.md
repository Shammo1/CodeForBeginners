## Getting Started

Before diving into competitive programming, you need to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and a programming language.We will learn all of this with c,c++.
## Step 1: Learn the Basics of a Programming Language

 Popular choices for competitive programming is C++.Because when it comes for CP c++ if faster then any other language.
- **Learn Syntax**: Understand the basic syntax, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Practice**: Solve simple problems to get comfortable with the language.

- [Basic C++ problem sheet](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/219158)

## Step 2: Understand Basic Data Structures

Data structures are the building blocks of competitive programming. Start with these basic ones:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**

### Recommended Resources:
- [GeeksforGeeks Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)
- [HackerRank Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript)

## Step 3: Learn Basic Algorithms

Once you're comfortable with data structures, start learning basic algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Recursion**
- **Backtracking**

### Recommended Resources:
- [Algorithm Basics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
- [Khan Academy Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

## Step 4: Practice Problem-Solving

Now that you have a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms, start solving problems:

- **Online Judges**: Platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) are great for practice.
- **Start Easy**: Begin with easy problems and gradually move to more complex ones.

### Recommended Problems:
- [LeetCode Easy Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=Easy)
- [HackerRank Problem Solving](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript)

## Step 5: Learn Advanced Data Structures

As you get more comfortable, move on to advanced data structures:

- **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees
- **Graphs**: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix
- **Heaps**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap
- **Trie**
- **Segment Trees**

### Recommended Resources:
- [Advanced Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advanced-data-structures/)
- [TopCoder Data Structures](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/)

## Step 6: Master Advanced Algorithms

Next, focus on mastering advanced algorithms:

- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- **Number Theory**
- **String Algorithms**: KMP, Rabin-Karp

### Recommended Resources:
- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- [Graph Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)

## Step 7: Participate in Contests

Finally, start participating in coding contests to test your skills:

- **Codeforces**
- **Codchef**
- **AtCoder**
- **LeetCode Contests**

### Tips:
- **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key.
- **Analyze Your Performance**: Learn from your mistakes and improve.
